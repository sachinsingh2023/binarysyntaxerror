Another way of installing Node.js that is particularly flexible is to use nvm, the Node Version Manager. This piece of software allows you to install and maintain many different independent versions of Node.js, and their associated Node packages, at the same time.
To install NVM on your Ubuntu 20.04 machine, visit the project’s GitHub page. Copy the curl command from the README file that displays on the main page. This will get you the most recent version of the installation script.
Before piping the command through to bash, it is always a good idea to audit the script to make sure it isn’t doing anything you don’t agree with. You can do that by removing the | bash segment at the end of the curl command:

//step1 
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh

Review the script and make sure you are comfortable with the changes it is making. When you are satisfied, run the command again with |
bash appended at the end. The URL you use will change depending on the latest version of nvm, but as of right now, the script can be downloaded and executed with the following:

//step2
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash

This will install the nvm script to your user account. To use it, you must first source your .bashrc file:

//step 3
source ~/.bashrc

//step4
nvm list-remote

  It’s a very long list. You can install a version of Node by writing in any of the release versions listed.
  For instance, to get version v14.10.0, you can run:
  
  //step5
  nvm install v14.10.0
  
  //step6
  nvm list
  
  Output
->     v14.10.0
       v14.21.2
default -> v14.10.0
iojs -> N/A (default)
unstable -> N/A (default)
node -> stable (-> v14.21.2) (default)
stable -> 14.21 (-> v14.21.2) (default)
. . .

Output
lts/* -> lts/hydrogen (-> N/A)
lts/argon -> v4.9.1 (-> N/A)
lts/boron -> v6.17.1 (-> N/A)
lts/carbon -> v8.17.0 (-> N/A)
lts/dubnium -> v10.24.1 (-> N/A)
lts/erbium -> v12.22.12 (-> N/A)
lts/fermium -> v14.21.2
lts/gallium -> v16.19.0 (-> N/A)
lts/hydrogen -> v18.13.0 (-> N/A)
  
  //step7
nvm install lts/hydrogen

Output
Downloading and installing node v18.13.0...
. . .
Now using node v18.13.0 (npm v8.19.3)

//step8
nvm use v14.10.0

//finshed
Output
Now using node v14.10.0 (npm v6.14.8)
```

You can verify that the install was successful using the same technique from the other sections:

```command and check now
node -v
